Auto-Login-AUTO-PROMPT (only for mac for now)
The purpose of this script is to simplify the process of logging into and using the public version of ChatGPT. It is designed for educational purposes only, and the prompts used in the script can be replaced or improved based on your needs.

Note: The script uses dummy strings for Your_email and Your_password. You will need to replace them with your actual email and password for the script to work properly.

Workflow:
The script will prompt you to choose one of five options. Four of the options are real and one is a dummy test.
Select an option and wait for your custom ChatGPT environment to load.
Enjoy!
Note: You must be logged in to ChatGPT on the main profile that loads in your main Chrome browser. Additionally, make sure that your Chrome preferences are set to save your login information for that website.
