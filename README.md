# Auto-Login-AUTO-PROMPT
The purpose of this script is only to make the process of logging into and using the 
public version of "your favorite Chat based AI site" much easier and 
more automatic. It is made with a prompt I personally optimized but it can always be replaced or improved for whatever purpose you want.

If you are seasoned python veteran:

I wrote this to use selenium and so make sure you have that updated as detailed below.
before running this script, make sure you run in terminal:
pip install undetected_chromedriver; pip install selenium
then
python3 name_of_script.py

Sorry the script isn't written in a basic definition format. I made it so it was as few lines of code as possible. Feel free to use it any way you want!

This was designed for Mac, but it would be simple to run it on windows, all you would have to do is change the file path for where the chrome driver is installed for your machine. But there is no guarantee it would work for windows as it was troubleshooted on mac only.
